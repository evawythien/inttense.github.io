My name is Eva. Currently I am studying computer science and working as a software developer.

Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).



The easiest way to make your first post is to edit this one. Go into /_posts/ and update the Hello World markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.



### About the site.
This URL has been my online home for many years, manifesting at times as a blog or a portfolio until landing on this current single-column blog. Today itâ€™s a bit of an outlet graveyard for my design-and development-related ramblings.

In case you were wondering, this site is:

**Designed and coded in Valladolid.
**Coded with Atom.
**Built on Jekyll, the open source static site generator.
**Hosted on GitHub Pages.
